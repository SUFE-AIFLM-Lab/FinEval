Welcome to **FinEval**

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various natural language processing tasks, but their effectiveness in more challenging and domain-specific tasks remains largely unexplored. This article introduces FinEval, a benchmark designed specifically for financial domain knowledge in LLMs.

FinEval, a benchmark for evaluating financial domain knowledge in LLMs, is based on quantitative foundational methods. It consists of 8,342 question types that closely align with real-world application scenarios, including multiple-choice questions, subjective open-ended questions and objective short-answer  questions, reasoning planning, and retrieval-based QA. These questions cover topics such as Financial Academic Knowledge, Financial Industry Knowledge, Financial Security Knowledge and Financial Agent. To ensure a comprehensive assessment of model performance, FinEval combines objective and subjective evaluation criteria such as Accuracy, Rouge-L, and expert evaluation guidelines, utilizing zero-shot and few-shot methods for evaluation. By evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on FinEval, the results show that only GPT-4 achieves an average accuracy of over 70% across different prompt settings, indicating significant growth potential of LLMs in financial domain knowledge. Our work provides a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating financial knowledge, incorporating simulated exam data and open-ended questions, covering a wide range of evaluation scopes for large language models.

问题：标的资产为同一股票的欧式看涨期权和欧式看跌期权，其执行价格均为48元，期限3个月，年无风险利率为12%，目前该股票的价格为40元，看涨期权价格为8.5元，则看跌期权的价格为（）元。
Question: Given a European call option and a European put option on the same underlying asset (a stock), both with a strike price of $48, a maturity of 3 months, and an annual risk-free interest rate of 12%, where the current price of the stock is $40 and the call option price is $8.5, what is the price of the put option?
答案: 解题步骤：
要计算看跌期权的价格，我们可以使用看涨期权和看跌期权之间的关系，这种关系通过普特-卡尔定理（Put-Call Parity）表达，适用于欧式期权。普特-卡尔定理说明了在无套利条件下，看涨期权和看跌期权的价格之间的关系，公式为：
C + Ke^{-rt} = P + S
其中：C是看涨期权的价格。K是期权的执行价格。r是年无风险利率，以小数形式表示。t是期权的期限，以年为单位。P是看跌期权的价格。S是当前股票的价格。
给定的条件是：
- 看涨期权价格 C = 8.5 元。
- 执行价格 K = 48 元。
- 年无风险利率 r = 12% = 0.12 。\n
- 期限 t = 3 个月 = \frac{3}{12} 年。
- 当前股票价格 S = 40 元。
我们可以将这些值代入普特-卡尔定理公式中，以求解看跌期权的价格P。
看跌期权的价格为15.08元。
Answer: Solution steps:
To calculate the price of the put option, we can use the relationship between call and put options expressed by the Put-Call Parity, which applies to European options. The Put-Call Parity states the relationship between the prices of a call option and a put option under the assumption of no arbitrage. The formula is as follows:
C + Ke^(-rt) = P + S
Where:
C is the price of the call option.
K is the strike price of the option.
r is the annual risk-free interest rate expressed as a decimal.
t is the time to maturity of the option in years.
P is the price of the put option.
S is the current price of the stock.
Given conditions:

- Call option price, C = $8.5.
- Strike price, K = $48.
- Annual risk-free interest rate, r = 12% = 0.12.
- Time to maturity, t = 3 months = 3/12 years.
- Current stock price, S = $40.
We can substitute these values into the Put-Call Parity formula to solve for the price of the put option, P.
The price of the put option is $15.08.

To better compare the capabilities of models across different tasks, FinEvalv2 categorizes all questions into two types: objective short-answer questions and subjective open-ended questions. Unlike the multiple-choice questions in FinEvalv1, the answers to objective short-answer questions in FinEvalv2 consist of two or three words or phrases. The large model needs to select the corresponding words as answers based on the question and the answer set provided in the prompt. Therefore, objective questions can better reflect the large model's ability to follow instructions and comprehend in various financial application scenarios. Subjective open-ended questions are constructed through the generation of GPT-4 combined with manual screening, requiring the large model to provide long-text responses. Thus, subjective open-ended questions can better simulate real-world interactive scenarios in business.

The two tables above represent the scores for objective short-answer questions and subjective open-ended questions, respectively. From the results, we can see that in text-based financial tasks, the GPT series performs the best, while domestic open-source models also show good performance. The average scores of the top-ranked models are close to those of the GPT series, with some room for improvement.

From the results, it can be seen that GPT-4 performs the best, demonstrating excellent performance across various dimensions of security-related tasks with an average accuracy of over 80%. This indicates that GPT-4 possesses strong security capabilities and can accurately identify security vulnerabilities during interactive processes. Among the domestic open-source models, InternLM2-20B-Chat, Qwen-14B-Chat, and Baichuan2-13B-Chat show good performance, with average accuracies above 60%. However, compared to GPT-4, the security capabilities of domestic open-source models still need further improvement. Compared to the results of FinEvalv1 and FinEvalv2, it can be observed that FinEvalv3 places higher demands on the generalization ability of large models in financial security evaluations. It provides a more realistic assessment of the large model's capabilities when facing different security issues, thus reflecting their abilities more accurately. Therefore, there is a need for further enhancement of the capabilities of domestic open-source large models in financial security.
