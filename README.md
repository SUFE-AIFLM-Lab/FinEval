Welcome to **FinEval**

Currently, while Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate excellent performance in general domains, their security and complex task processing capabilities in the highly specialized and risk-sensitive financial industry remain uncertain. This paper introduces FinEval, a pioneering Chinese benchmark dataset constructed to comprehensively evaluate the professional capabilities and security of LLMs in the financial domain, providing a solid foundation for addressing this challenge.

The FinEval financial domain evaluation benchmark, based on quantitative fundamental methods and developed through long-term objective research, summarization, and rigorous manual screening, utilizes over 26,000 diverse question types that are highly consistent with real-world application scenarios. These include multiple-choice questions, subjective and objective short-answer questions, reasoning and planning tasks, and retrieval-based question answering, covering financial academic knowledge, financial industry knowledge, financial security knowledge, financial intelligent agents, financial multi-modality, and financial rigor. It aims to comprehensively examine the overall application capabilities of large models in the financial domain. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation of model performance, FinEval combines subjective and objective scoring standards in its textual capability tests, including Accuracy, Rouge-L, and detailed expert evaluation criteria. It employs zero-shot, five-shot, zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and five-shot CoT methods for evaluation.

By evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on FinEval, the textual performance results show that Claude 3.5-Sonnet, under a zero-shot setting, achieved the highest average score of 72.9 across all financial domain tasks, indicating significant growth potential for LLMs in financial domain knowledge. In the multi-modal performance results, Qwen-VL-max performed the best among all evaluated models, achieving an average score of 76.3 and securing the top scores among evaluated models in ten sub-scenarios. This strongly suggests that Qwen-VL-max possesses stable and robust capabilities across multi-modal business scenarios of varying depths within finance. Our work provides a more comprehensive benchmark for financial knowledge assessment, utilizing common images from financial business scenarios, simulated examination data, and some open-ended questions, covering a broad scope of LLM evaluation.

问题：标的资产为同一股票的欧式看涨期权和欧式看跌期权，其执行价格均为48元，期限3个月，年无风险利率为12%，目前该股票的价格为40元，看涨期权价格为8.5元，则看跌期权的价格为（）元。
Question: Given a European call option and a European put option on the same underlying asset (a stock), both with a strike price of $48, a maturity of 3 months, and an annual risk-free interest rate of 12%, where the current price of the stock is $40 and the call option price is $8.5, what is the price of the put option?
答案: 解题步骤：
要计算看跌期权的价格，我们可以使用看涨期权和看跌期权之间的关系，这种关系通过普特-卡尔定理（Put-Call Parity）表达，适用于欧式期权。普特-卡尔定理说明了在无套利条件下，看涨期权和看跌期权的价格之间的关系，公式为：
C + Ke^{-rt} = P + S
其中：C是看涨期权的价格。K是期权的执行价格。r是年无风险利率，以小数形式表示。t是期权的期限，以年为单位。P是看跌期权的价格。S是当前股票的价格。
给定的条件是：
- 看涨期权价格 C = 8.5 元。
- 执行价格 K = 48 元。
- 年无风险利率 r = 12% = 0.12 。\n
- 期限 t = 3 个月 = \frac{3}{12} 年。
- 当前股票价格 S = 40 元。
我们可以将这些值代入普特-卡尔定理公式中，以求解看跌期权的价格P。
看跌期权的价格为15.08元。
Answer: Solution steps:
To calculate the price of the put option, we can use the relationship between call and put options expressed by the Put-Call Parity, which applies to European options. The Put-Call Parity states the relationship between the prices of a call option and a put option under the assumption of no arbitrage. The formula is as follows:
C + Ke^(-rt) = P + S
Where:
C is the price of the call option.
K is the strike price of the option.
r is the annual risk-free interest rate expressed as a decimal.
t is the time to maturity of the option in years.
P is the price of the put option.
S is the current price of the stock.
Given conditions:

- Call option price, C = $8.5.
- Strike price, K = $48.
- Annual risk-free interest rate, r = 12% = 0.12.
- Time to maturity, t = 3 months = 3/12 years.
- Current stock price, S = $40.
We can substitute these values into the Put-Call Parity formula to solve for the price of the put option, P.
The price of the put option is $15.08.

To better compare the capabilities of models across different tasks, FinEval categorizes all questions into two types: objective short-answer questions and subjective open-ended questions. Unlike the multiple-choice questions in Finance Academic Knowledge, the answers to objective short-answer questions in Finance Industry Knowledge consist of two or three words or phrases. The large model needs to select the corresponding words as answers based on the question and the answer set provided in the prompt. Therefore, objective questions can better reflect the large model's ability to follow instructions and comprehend in various financial application scenarios. Subjective open-ended questions are constructed through the generation of GPT-4 combined with manual screening, requiring the large model to provide long-text responses. Thus, subjective open-ended questions can better simulate real-world interactive scenarios in business.

The two tables show that GPT-4o outperforms other models in objective tasks with an average score of 78.1, excelling in categories like FSA and NEE. Closed-source models like Gemini-1.5-flash also perform well, closely trailing GPT-4o. For subjective tasks, Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct leads with a score of 39.3, followed by Claude 3.5-sonnet at 38.8. While closed-source models dominate, open-source models show strong potential, narrowing the performance gap.
