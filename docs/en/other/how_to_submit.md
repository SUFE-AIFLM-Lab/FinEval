# How to Submit Your Assessment
You first need to prepare a UTF-8 encoded JSON file and write it in the following format.
```
## The key inside each subject is the "id" field in the dataset
{
    "banking_practitioner_qualification_certificate": {
        "0": "A",
        "1": "B",
        "2": "B",
        ...
    },
    
    "Subject Name":{
    "0":"Answer1",
    "1":"Answer2",
    ...
    }
    ....
}
```
Then you can submit the prepared JSON file to zhang.liwen@shufe.edu.cn.
